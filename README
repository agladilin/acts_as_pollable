ActsAsPollable
==============

This plugin allows polls, integrated with your user model, within your application.

Install plugin
  
  * Run the generator command:

  ./script/generate acts_as_pollable

  * Update the database, running migration: 

  rake db:migrate 

Create poll

  * To create a poll use the following command:

  ./script/runner vendor/plugins/acts_as_pollable/create_poll.rb

  The script will ask you which are the answers, which is the questions displayed, among other configurations (allows multiple selection, who is allowed to vote: registered users, anonymous, etc.) for the poll.

Show poll in views

   * Insert the poll helper in your view:

      #someview.rhtml (where you want to show the poll)
      ..
      <%= poll ( poll_name, { :in_place => true, :redirect_to => some_url, :view_dir => view_directory } ) %>
      ..

      Where:

          * poll_name. This is the name that identifies the poll to display. This is the only required parameter.
          * :in_place. Enables AJAX functionality to the poll if it is set to true, otherwise the hole page would be reload while submitting a vote.
          * :redirect_to. This is an url to redirect after the vote.
          * :view_dir. If present, it loads the poll views (show_poll, already_vote, user_not_logged, etc) from the directory set by this parameter. Otherwise, all views will be taken from RAILS_APP/vendor/plugins/acts_as_pollable/views.

   * Insert act_as_vote_handler statement in the controller of the view (where the poll helper is used):

      class SomeController
        
         acts_as_vote_handler
        
        ..
      end
